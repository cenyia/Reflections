When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you're collaborating with others or just sharing with others so that they may make use
  of what you want to make public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
    Possibly because you may not want to share certain files or changes immediately after creating them.
