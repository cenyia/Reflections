When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you're collaborating with others or just sharing with others so that they may make use
  of what you want to make public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
    Possibly because you may not want to share certain files or changes immediately after creating them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks are a way of cloning between git hub accounts and cloning takes repos from git hub and places them on your
    local machine.  Branches are used when working with a repo and wanting to test, experiment, or do something separate
    from the work you have already established.
